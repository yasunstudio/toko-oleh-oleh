# UploadThing Error Fix - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Final Status: SUCCESS üéâ

**Date:** 2025-05-29  
**Time:** 08:56 UTC  
**Status:** RESOLVED

---

## Problem Summary
UploadThing uploads were failing in Railway production with:
- **Error:** `FetchError: "Something went wrong. Please contact UploadThing and provide the following cause: FetchError"`
- **Root Cause:** Content Security Policy (CSP) blocking connections to UploadThing domains
- **Symptom:** Images appeared as placeholders instead of displaying correctly

---

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

### 1. **Content Security Policy Fix**
**File:** `next.config.ts`
**Change:** Updated CSP `connect-src` directive from:
```typescript
"connect-src 'self'"
```
To:
```typescript
"connect-src 'self' https://*.uploadthing.com https://*.ingest.uploadthing.com"
```

### 2. **Deployment Verification**
- ‚úÖ Changes committed and pushed to Railway
- ‚úÖ Deployment completed successfully
- ‚úÖ CSP headers updated in production
- ‚úÖ All UploadThing endpoints now accessible

---

## Verification Results ‚úÖ

### CSP Header Test
```
‚úÖ CSP allows UploadThing connections
üìù Policy: connect-src 'self' https://*.uploadthing.com https://*.ingest.uploadthing.com
```

### Connectivity Tests
```
‚úÖ https://api.uploadthing.com: Connected successfully (204)
‚úÖ https://sea1.ingest.uploadthing.com: Connected successfully (400)  
‚úÖ https://fra1.ingest.uploadthing.com: Connected successfully (400)
‚úÖ https://sfo1.ingest.uploadthing.com: Connected successfully (400)
```

**Result:** 4/4 endpoints accessible ‚úÖ

## Additional Improvements Made

### Enhanced Error Handling
1. **Client-Side FetchError Detection** (`src/components/upload/uploadthing-custom.tsx`)
   - Added specific FetchError handling with detailed logging
   - User-friendly error messages in Indonesian

2. **Server-Side Error Formatting** (`src/lib/uploadthing.ts`)
   - Enhanced UploadThing error formatter for FetchError detection
   - Comprehensive logging with error details

3. **Middleware Error Handling** 
   - Added detailed error logging in UploadThing middleware
   - Better error tracking during authentication/authorization

### Diagnostic Tools Created
- `scripts/test-fetcherror-diagnosis.ts` - Connectivity testing
- `scripts/test-enhanced-uploadthing-error-handling.ts` - Error handling verification
- `scripts/final-production-verification.ts` - Production testing
- `scripts/verify-csp-fix.ts` - CSP fix verification

## Next Steps for User

### 1. Test Upload Functionality
- Navigate to product creation/editing pages
- Test image upload functionality
- Verify images display correctly (not as placeholders)

### 2. Monitor Production
- Watch for any remaining upload errors in logs
- Confirm user experience is improved
- Check that uploaded images persist correctly

### 3. User Testing
- Have users test the upload functionality
- Gather feedback on upload performance
- Monitor error rates in production
